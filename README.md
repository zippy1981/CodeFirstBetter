# Code First Better Demo

This repo explains how to do code first better. It's used as part ofo my SQL Saturday talks, so the improvements are on feature branches..

## Installing

See if you have your localdb setup buy running `sqllocaldb i MSSQLLocalDB` at a cmd or powershell prompt. If you see output similar to 


```
Name:               MSSQLLocalDB
Version:            15.0.4153.1
Shared name:
Owner:              AzureAD\JustinDearing
Auto-create:        Yes
State:              Stopped
Last start time:    7/30/2022 11:34:54 PM
Instance pipe name:
```

It is setup. If you instead see `The automatic instance "MSSQLLocalDB" is not created.` Then run `sqllocaldb create MSSQLLocalDB`.
